# Network Security Repository

This repository contains several Packet Tracer files (.pka) and other resources related to network security. The Packet Tracer files were created as part of various network security courses and cover topics such as AAA authentication, access control lists (ACLs), syslog, NTP, SSH, and OSPF.

## Packet Tracer Files

The following Packet Tracer files are included in this repository:

- `2.6.1.3_Packet_Tracer_-_Configure_Cisco_Routers_for_Syslog_NTP_and_SSH_Operations.pka`: This file demonstrates how to configure Cisco routers for syslog, NTP, and SSH operations.

- `3.6.1.2_Packet_Tracer_-_Configure_AAA_Authentication_on_Cisco_Routers_1.pka`: This file demonstrates how to configure AAA authentication on Cisco routers.

- `4.1.1.10_Packet_Tracer_-_Configuring_Extended_ACLs_Scenario_1.pka`: This file demonstrates how to configure extended ACLs in a scenario involving multiple subnets.

- `4.1.1.11_Packet_Tracer_-_Configuring_Extended_ACLs_Scenario_2.pka`: This file demonstrates how to configure extended ACLs in a scenario involving multiple interfaces on a single router.

- `AAA_Tacacs_RADIUS.pkt`: This file demonstrates the use of AAA protocols (TACACS+ and RADIUS) for authentication, authorization, and accounting.

- `ACL_Access_control_list.pkt`: This file demonstrates the use of standard and extended access control lists (ACLs) to control traffic flow.

- `extended_access_control_list.pkt`: This file demonstrates the use of extended ACLs to control traffic flow between multiple subnets.

- `OSPF_MD5.pkt`: This file demonstrates how to configure OSPF with MD5 authentication.

- `telnet_ssh_authentication.pkt`: This file demonstrates the use of Telnet and SSH protocols for authentication.
